            He has a seemingly boundless amount of recipes he has shown in his
            videos, ranging from alcoholic drinks to slightly edible food, to
            not so edible food. I couldn't find any resources online that share
            his recipes, so I decided to make my own.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alcohol drink combos are for of-age(21 and up) fans and I don't
            recommend actually eating any of the food that is an outcome of
            these recipes, but some of it I'm sure will amuse and satiate you in
            some capacity. Cobra's Mist is somehow actually decent.
