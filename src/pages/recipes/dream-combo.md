## Ingredients

- Fleischmann's vodka
- Coca-Cola

## Instructions

Although the video is titled "Drink combo," there are no specific measurements provided by Gothic King Cobra for this drink. So, we'll have to assume it's a 50/50 mix of Fleischmann's vodka and Coca-Cola. However, Gothic King Cobra did drop some bars, showcasing his lyrical prowess:

sippin' on that vodka and coke
cause you know I'm no joke
take a trip down to Colorado
and buy some weed and have a toke
stanley steemer hotel
fucking with ghosts and getting stoned
