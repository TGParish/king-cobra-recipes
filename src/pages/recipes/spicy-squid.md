## Instructions

First, take a sip of Lester Fixins Soda and make sure it really tastes like Mustard. Once you know it's not bullshit, move onto the next step below:

Pour the entire GOYA Jumbo Squid into a cobra-themed pint glass. Some extra room is required for the other ingredients, so use a fork to eat some of the squid and oils from the glass. Stop eating when roughly a quarter of the glass is filled.

Next, pour in the Lester Fixins soda. Then, pour in the Lime Cucumber Gatorade. It's not finished yet, but start drinking some anyway. Next, pour in the Pacifico Beer. Finally, add a splash of Lester Fixins AND a splash of Lime Cucumber Gatorade to top it off.

Before you start chugging away at this gnarly-looking drink combo, let it stoop and get all funky in the glass. Enjoy!
