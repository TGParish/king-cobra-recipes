Jolly good, this crazy mixologist is at it again. This time with malt liquor and Monster. Hold onto your britches, bitches! Ha ha ha yesss.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Olde English 800

- 1/2 cup Monster Energy Drink

## Instructions

First, pour the Olde English 800 into a badass skeleton mug. Then, drink an extra swig straight from the original bottle. Next, disclose that you're 80% British and probably related to some cool people. That's what's up! Now, it's time to pour the stimulant into the depressant. Be very careful; half and half always. Cheers, mate!
